# Deep Reinforcement Learning Game Agents

Each Folder contains an iPython notebook with an RL-based game agent that uses Deep Neural Networks to maximize its reward. 

## Games Included
1. Q Learning for Frozen Lake (Matrix Maze-type game)
2. OpenAI Taxi-v2

## Running the Notebooks
Simplest approach:
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Upload the folder to Google Drive
3. Open each notebook with Google Colab and run through Google Cloud's free hosted environment for iPython.

Using the concepts from this course, I built my agents and spent extra time optimizing for speed and performance.
